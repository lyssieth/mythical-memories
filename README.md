# Mythical Memories

A storage mod with a magical nature.

## Goals

- [ ] A basic, expandable, storage system
- [ ] Importing/exporting via magical devices
- [ ] Something like the AE2 'Interface' and 'Storage Bus'
- [ ] Automatic Crafting (stretch goal, my ability to code isn't _that_ good)

## Inspiration

I really like the concept of [Arcane Archives](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/arcane-archives), but I was saddened when it never updated past 1.12.  
My inspirations come from AE2, Refined Storage, and of course my love of magic.

## Requirements

- [owo](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/) (documentation linked so i don't lose it because i'm an idiot)
